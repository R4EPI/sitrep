#' Add a column of cluster survey weights to a data frame.
#'
#' For use in surveys where you took a sample population out of a larger
#' source population, with a cluster survey design.
#'
#' Will multiply the inverse chances of a cluster being selected, a household
#' being selected within a cluster, and an individual being selected within a
#' household.
#'
#' As follows:
#'
#' ```
#' ((clusters available) / (clusters surveyed)) *
#' ((households in each cluster) / (households surveyed in each cluster)) *
#' ((individuals eligible in each household) / (individuals interviewed))
#' ```
#'
#' In the case where both ignore_cluster and ignore_household are TRUE, this
#' will simply be:
#'
#' ```
#' 1 * 1 * (individuals eligible in each household) / (individuals interviewed)
#' ```
#'
#' @param x a data frame of survey data
#'
#' @param cl a data frame containing a list of clusters and the number of
#'   households in each.
#'
#' @param eligible the column in `x` which specifies the number of people
#'   eligible for being interviewed in that household. (e.g. the total number of
#'   children)
#'
#' @param interviewed the column in `x` which specifies the number of people
#'   actually interviewed in that household.
#'
#' @param cluster_cl the column in `cl` that lists all possible clusters.
#'   Ignored if `ignore_cluster` is TRUE.
#'
#' @param cluster_x the column in `x` that indicates which cluster rows belong
#'   to. Ignored if `ignore_cluster` is TRUE.
#'
#' @param household_cl the column in `cl` that lists the number of households
#'   per cluster.  Ignored if `ignore_household` is TRUE.
#'
#' @param household_x the column in `x` that indicates a unique household
#'   identifier. Ignored if `ignore_household` is TRUE.
#'
#' @param ignore_cluster If TRUE (default), set the weight for clusters to be 1.
#'   This assumes that your sample was taken in a way which is a close
#'   approximation of a simple random sample. Ignores inputs from `cluster_cl`
#'   as well as `cluster_x`.
#'
#' @param ignore_household If TRUE (default), set the weight for households to
#'   be 1. This assumes that your sample of households was takenin a way which
#'   is a close approximation of a simple random sample. Ignores inputs from
#'   `household_cl` and `household_x`.
#'
#' @param surv_weight the name of the new column to store the weights. Defaults
#'   to "surv_weight".
#'
#' @param surv_weight_ID the name of the new ID column to be created. Defaults
#'   to "surv_weight_ID"
