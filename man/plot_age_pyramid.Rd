\title{Plot a population pyramid (age-sex) from a dataframe.}
\usage{
plot_age_pyramid(
  data,
  age_group = "age_group",
  split_by = "sex",
  stack_by = NULL,
  proportional = FALSE,
  na.rm = TRUE,
  show_halfway = TRUE,
  vertical_lines = FALSE,
  horizontal_lines = TRUE,
  pyramid = TRUE,
  pal = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Your dataframe (e.g. linelist)}

\item{age_group}{the name of a column in the data frame that defines the age
group categories. Defaults to "age_group"}

\item{split_by}{the name of a column in the data frame that defines the
the bivariate column. Defaults to "sex". See NOTE}

\item{stack_by}{the name of the column in the data frame to use for shading
the bars}

\item{proportional}{If \code{TRUE}, bars will represent proportions of cases out
of the entire population. Otherwise (\code{FALSE}, default), bars represent
case counts}

\item{na.rm}{If \code{TRUE}, this removes NA counts from the age groups. Defaults
to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{show_halfway}{When \code{TRUE} (default), a dashed vertical line will be
added to each of the age bars showing the halfway point for the
un-stratified age group. When \code{FALSE}, no halfway point is marked.}

\item{vertical_lines}{If you would like to add dashed vertical lines to help
visual interpretation of numbers. Default is to not show (\code{FALSE}),
to turn on write \code{TRUE}.}

\item{horizontal_lines}{If \code{TRUE} (default), horizontal dashed lines will
appear behind the bars of the pyramid}

\item{pyramid}{if \code{TRUE}, then binary \code{split_by} variables will result in
a population pyramid (non-binary variables cannot form a pyramid). If
\code{FALSE}, a pyramid will not form.}

\item{pal}{a color palette function or vector of colors to be passed to
\code{\link[ggplot2:scale_manual]{ggplot2::scale_fill_manual()}} defaults to the first "qual" palette from
\code{\link[ggplot2:scale_brewer]{ggplot2::scale_fill_brewer()}}.}
}
\description{
Plot a population pyramid (age-sex) from a dataframe.
}
\note{
If the \code{split_by} variable is bivariate (e.g. an indicator for
pregnancy), then the result will show up as a pyramid, otherwise, it will be
presented as a facetted barplot with with empty bars in the background
indicating the range of the un-facetted data set. Values of \code{spit_by} will
show up as labels at top of each facet.
