The goal of {sitrep} is provide report templates for common epidemiological
surveys and outbreak reports. The package further contains helper function that
standardize certain analyses. 

While templates are primarily for MSF analyses - they have been setup to be as
generic as possible for use by the general applied epidemiology community. 

**Detailed information about the project and the templates can be found at <https://r4epis.netlify.com>.**  
An online manual for the functions in {sitrep} can be found at <https://r4epi.github.io/sitrep>.  

{sitrep} includes a number of other *R* packages which facilitate specific analysis:  
[{epitabulate}](https://r4epi.github.io/epitabulate): Tables for epidemiological analysis  
[{epidict}](https://r4epi.github.io/epidict): Epidemiology data dictionaries and random data generators  
[{epikit}](https://r4epi.github.io/epikit): Miscellaneous helper tools for epidemiologists  
[{apyramid}](https://r4epi.github.io/apyramid): Age pyramid construction and plotting  


## Installation

The **{sitrep}** package, developed by MSF and partners, is stored in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/R4EPI/sitrep). 
Therefore, the procedure to install these packages have one extra step required. 

To install **sitrep** from GitHub you must first install the **drat** package.

``` r
install.packages("drat", repos = "https://cran.rstudio.com")
```

Once **drat** is installed, use its `addRepo()` function to add the "R4EPI" project to the list of valid repositories.
This command below will install the [latest release of the **{sitrep}** package](https://github.com/R4EPI/sitrep/releases) and also install any packages necessary for use of the templates that are not currently installed on your machine.

```r
drat::addRepo("R4EPI")
install.packages("sitrep")
```

## Available templates

Sitrep has [four outbreak templates](https://r4epis.netlify.com/outbreaks/) and
[three survey templates](https://r4epis.netlify.com/surveys/) available. These
templates will generate the following:

1. A word document with the situation report
2. A plain text markdown document (for conversion to other formats such as HTML or PDF)
3. A directory with all of the figures produced

You can access the list of templates in *R Studio* by clicking (see example below): 
file > New file > R Markdown... > From Template

![Example of how to open and save the cholera template](https://github.com/R4EPI/R4EPIs-website/raw/master/content/welcome/images/opening_template.gif)


You can generate an example template by using the `check_sitrep_templates()`
function:

```{r check_templates, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library("sitrep")
output_dir <- file.path(tempdir(), "sitrep_example")
dir.create(output_dir)

# view the available templates, categorized by type
available_sitrep_templates(categorise = TRUE)

# generate the measles outbreak template in the output directory
check_sitrep_templates("measles_outbreak", path = output_dir)

# view the contents
list.files(output_dir, recursive = TRUE)
```
