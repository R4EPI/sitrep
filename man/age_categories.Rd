\usage{
age_categories(
  x,
  breakers = NA,
  lower = 0,
  upper = NA,
  by = 10,
  separator = "-",
  ceiling = FALSE,
  above.char = "+"
)

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Your age variable}

\item{breakers}{A string. Age category breaks you can define within c().
Alternatively use "lower", "upper" and "by" to set these breaks based on a
sequence.}

\item{lower}{A number. The lowest age value you want to consider (default is 0)}

\item{upper}{A number. The highest age value you want to consider}

\item{by}{A number. The number of years you want between groups}

\item{separator}{A character that you want to have between ages in group
names. The default is "-" producing e.g. 0-10.}

\item{ceiling}{A TRUE/FALSE variable. Specify whether you would like the
highest value in your breakers, or alternatively the upper value specified,
to be the endpoint. This would produce the highest group of "70-80" rather
than "80+". The default is FALSE (to produce a group of 80+).}

\item{above.char}{Only considered when ceiling == FALSE.  A character that
you want to have after your highest age group. The default is "+" producing
e.g. 80+}

\item{dat}{a data frame with at least one column defining an age category}

\item{years, months, weeks, days}{the bare name of the column defining years,
months, weeks, or days (or NULL if the column doesn't exist)}

\item{one_column}{if \code{TRUE} (default), the categories will be joined into a
single column called "age_category" that appends the type of age category
used. If \code{FALSE}, there will be one column with the grouped age categories
called "age_category" and a second column indicating age unit called
"age_unit".}

\item{drop_empty_overlaps}{if \code{TRUE}, unused levels are dropped if they have
been replaced by a more fine-grained definition and are empty. Practically,
this means that the first level for years, months, and weeks are in
consideration for being removed via \code{\link[forcats:fct_drop]{forcats::fct_drop()}}}
