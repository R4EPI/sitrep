## Origin 

Applied Epi Tools originated out of the R4epis project. 
R4epis started in 2018 as a partnership between Médecins Sans Frontières ([MSF](https://www.artsenzondergrenzen.nl/)
the R for Epidemics Consortium ([RECON](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/)). 
In 2021, [Applied Epi](https://appliedepi.org/) was contracted by MSF to finalise 
the project. 

## Aim

The aim of the R4epis project was to develop standardised data cleaning, analysis
and reporting tools to cover common types of outbreaks and population-based surveys
that would be conducted in an MSF emergency response setting.

This was done through the development of the R package {sitrep}. 
The package provides field epidemiologists with novel data management tools as 
well as templates of automated "situation reports" that cover outbreak 
investigations (acute jaundice syndrome, cholera, measles, meningitis) and three 
of the MSF ERB pre-approved surveys (mortality, nutrition and vaccination).

All of the report templates are contained within the sitrep package as RMarkdown 
templates that can easily be used from within RStudio. 
The user then modifies a template to his/her needs.

The templates address all aspects of:

Data cleaning of outbreak linelists and survey data
Analysis of data to report in terms of time, place, and person
Analysis of survey data


## Funding
R4epis was initially funded through the [Sapling Nursery](https://msf.org.uk/sapling-nursery),
an MSF internal innovation fund for new projects that aim to improve the medical 
care MSF provides. This funding was secured by Annick Lenglet and Amrish Baidjoe. 
In 2021, MSF Operational Centre Amsterdam awarded Applied Epi with a contract to
finalise the project. 

## Contributers

The project has merged the skills and experience of people in coding in R software, field epidemiology, spatial epidemiology, health information systems and public health.
